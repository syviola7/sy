                <strong>SUMMARY:</strong>
            <details>
                Ruan An’an, who had a net worth in the tens of billions, returned to her alma mater to donate a building
                and fell in love with a college student there.
                <br>
                <br>
                The boy wore a washed-out shirt. His figure was slender and tall. With black hair, light-colored pupils,
                and an elegant jawline, he looked incredibly beautiful.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ruan An’an was dazzled by his charms and accidentally bumped into him. The college student picked up the
                files she dropped and smiled, “fellow student, watch your step.”
                <br>
                <br>
                His voice was as clear as spring water and his person as handsome as jade.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the first time in her life, Ruan An’an was struck by love.
                <br>
                <br>
                She created an opportunity for herself by changing her identity.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the story goes, a sweet girl with financial difficulties, who constantly strived for
                self-improvement, quickly fell in love with a poor-yet-handsome male college student. The two were in
                tune with each other in all aspects and got married in just half a year.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although they were hard-pressed for money even after marriage, it did not affect their relationship.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the night before their wedding anniversary, Ruan An’an had changed in one of her exquisite business
                attires at work, as usual, and went to attend a private meeting with the so-called “mysterious major
                shareholder”.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Ms. Ruan,” the secretary introduced: “This is Mr. Gu, Gu Jue.”
                <br>
                <br>
                Ruan An’an stared at the man whom she shared a bed with in a 100-square-meter apartment every night. He
                was impeccably dressed, looking very sharp and honorable.
                <br>
                <br>
                …She almost broke her high heels.
                <br>
                <br>
                “An’an,” He said with a warm smile that melted his iciness: “Let’s move to Lin Jiang Mansion, I built a
                garden for you.”
                <br>
                <br>
                Ruan An’an: “…”
                <br>
                <br>
                Damn you! What “poor-yet-handsome college student”? It was all a set up!
