                <strong>SUMMARY:</strong>
            <details>
  The most impressive thing that the timid and cowardly Wen Zhichu has done in his entire life was rescuing two grade schoolers who had ignored the red light and crossed the streets recklessly. As for the result of his one-time bravery, he also sent himself off.
<br>
When he woke up again, he discovered that he had transmigrated into a book as a cannon fodder villain who keeps hopping back and forth on the edge of a minefield— ultimately, receiving the ending of sleeping on the streets for offending the protagonist.
<br>
Wen Zhichu, who’s been told by his mom since young that he has a delicate body and couldn’t sleep on the streets: !
<br>
Just as Wen Zhichu planned to stop participating in this world’s story plot and become an insignificant, transparent character, he accidentally became bound to a villain system. If he didn’t follow the original plotline to cause trouble for the protagonist, he’d be deducted money and forced to sleep on the streets even sooner than the original story.
<br>
Wen Zhichu: : )
<br>
Wen Zhichu was forced onto the path of a villain. Every time he sees the protagonist’s strong, robust body, even his calves start trembling.
<br>
One punch would probably K.O. two of him.
<br>
The villain’s mission: Destroy the protagonist’s lunch.
<br>
Looking at the protagonist sitting to the side, Wen Zhichu swallowed his saliva, threw a handful of rainbow-colored skittles into the food, and then ran off immediately.
<br>
Qin Jiashu: ……
<br>
The Villain’s mission: Ruin the Protagonist’s main love line.
<br>
Heading to the protagonist’s locker, Wen Zhichu scooped out the mountain pile of love letters inside, leaving behind only his own falsified love letter.
<br>
Qin Jiashu, who just happened to see everything after returning from playing basketball: ……
<br>
The Villain’s mission: Destroy the protagonist’s belonging.
<br>
Holding a needle, Wen Zhichu stealthily arrived at the school’s parking lot and prepared to puncture the protagonist’s car tire.
<br>
Who’d expect the utterly unreliable Wen Zhichu would bump straight into the protagonist this time.
<br>
Wen Zhichu hastily hid the needle behind his back.
<br>
Two of him was not even enough for the other to beat up.
<br>
The protagonist raised his hand. Wen Zhichu subconsciously covered his head.
<br>
Qin Jiashu patted the front bumper of the car: “Get in, I’ll drive you.”
<br>
Wen Zhichu: ? ? ?
<br>
All of Qin Jiashu’s bros knew that about the dark and withdrawn, annoying pest in the neighboring class, who came over every few days to cause trouble.
<br>
Once Qin Jiashu was buying a sports drink at the store, sure enough, that annoying pest followed over as well. Not surprisingly, that annoying pest snatched away the item that Qin Jiashu wanted to buy in advance and even opened it to take a drink right in front of him.
<br>
Qin Jiashu stopped him. Right before they thought he’d teach that annoying as*hole a lesson, Qin Jiashu actually grabbed the already opened sports drink from Wen Zhichu’s hand, tossed his head back, and started drinking it.
<br>
Qin Jiashu: Very sorry, but I’ve already reached happy ending.
