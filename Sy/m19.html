                Tang Tang got pushed into the pond by her step sister who frequently bullied her. She thought she would
                meet her dead mother but, who knew, when she opened her eyes again, she was in a strange place. But what
                made her happy was that she had a super handsome husband and a very cute son. The most important thing
                was that her husband was good. He was a hero who protects the country, and earns money to support her
                and their son. Also, he only has her as his wife, he didn’t have any concubines or whatsoever. Tang Tang
                decided she should be submissive to her husband, to be a good wife and a loving mother. Her nanny no
                longer needed to worry about her not being able to get married anymore!
